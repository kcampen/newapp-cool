Experimenting with Backbone and modals

This is an amature form built for practice purposes as a homeowrk assignment for The Iron Yard. The app utilizes Bootstrap and Backbone. The app allows you to input information and appends the information to a list. If the user does not provide information there are defaults that will occupy those fields. This is not fit for production.
